# Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is **CamSeq01 Dataset**[1]. It is a video sequence of high resolution images, that is designed specifically for the problem of autonomous driving.
The sequence has been recorded in a moving vehicle in the city of Cambridge. You can find the link to the dataset [here](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/VideoRec/CamSeq01/CamSeq01.zip)

The dataset has **101** images with size **960x720** pixels. Each pixel has been manually labelled to one of **32 classes**.

In this repository, the classes has been grouped to 12 classes, see **data_handler/data.py**

# Download the dataset
Run the following command in the root of this repository

````bash
python ./utils/download_dataset.py --savedir="./dataset/camvid/"
````

# Repository structure

* **data_handler**: has all the functions necessary for visualizing and processing the dataset
* **model_builder**: Has necessary methods for creating and training the model
* **utils**: Has utility functions for downloading the dataset and plotting metrics during training.
* *camseq_semantic_segmentation.ipynb*: Notebook for training the model and evaluating the model.
* *requirements.txt*: has the required packages for the project to run in colab.

# Execution
This project was implemented using google colab. Thus it requires 1 GPU and 12GB memory.

To install the necessary packages, run :

````bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
# Training and Evaluation
The required time to train SegFormer-B2 was 10 hours.
